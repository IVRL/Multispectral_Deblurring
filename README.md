# Multispectral_Deblurring
[Majed El Helou](https://majedelhelou.github.io/), Zahra Sadeghipoor, Sabine SÃ¼sstrunk

This repository contains the needed code to run the functions of "Correlation-Based Deblurring Leveraging Multispectral 
Chromatic Aberration in Color and Near-Infrared Joint Acquisition". Simply run `DEMO_multispectral_deblur`, it saves intermediate 
results in the folder `ResultsRGBY`. To obtain the correlation maps used in the paper's correlation study, use `corr2_across_patches.m`.

The folder `Guided_Deblurring` contains the demo and code of "Multiscale Guided Deblurring: Chromatic Aberration 
Correction in Color and Near-Infrared Imaging". Simply run `demo`.

To test with different RGB-NIR image pairs, [this dataset can be downloaded](https://ivrl.epfl.ch/research-2/research-downloads/supplementary_material-cvpr11-index-html/).
Replace inside `Guided_Deblurring` the images `rgb.tiff` and `nir.tiff`.
